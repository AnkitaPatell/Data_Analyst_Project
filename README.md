#  Healthcare Appointment No-Show Prediction

This project aims to predict whether patients will miss their scheduled medical appointments using a real-world dataset. Missed appointments are a common challenge in healthcare, leading to inefficient scheduling and resource wastage. By identifying key patterns in patient behavior, this model supports better decision-making to reduce no-shows and improve service delivery.

##  Objective
To build a predictive model that classifies patients as likely to show or not show for their appointments, and to provide actionable insights for healthcare providers.

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Power BI**: For data visualization and dashboard reporting

---

##  Steps Involved
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (removed irrelevant columns, renamed fields, handled dates)
- Feature engineering (e.g., waiting time, day of the week)
- Encoded categorical variables
- Trained a Decision Tree classifier
- Analyzed key trends (e.g., SMS reminders, age groups, weekdays)
- Built an interactive dashboard in Power BI

---

##  Deliverables
- Trained ML model to predict appointment no-shows (Healthcare_Appointment_No-Show_Prediction_Project.ipynb)
- Power BI dashboard for exploratory insights (Appointment No-Show_Power_BI_Dashboard.pbix)
- Recommendations for scheduling optimization (e.g., send SMS to younger patients, avoid peak no-show days)
- Project report (Healthcare_Appointment_No_Show_Report.docx)
